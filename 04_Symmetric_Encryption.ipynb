    "# Symmetric Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is the process of transforming a message, usually called cyphered message, in such a way that only the intended parties can reverse it. The process of reversing encryption is called decryption. This implies that, as opposed to hashes, encryption is **reversible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of encryption, symmetric and asymmetric, this chapter will cover symmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In symmetric encryption, the message to be sent is encrypted using a single **secret** password, also called key. Anyone with that secret key and decrypt the message and see the original content. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of encryption is fast, reliable and extremely secure, however it has a major disadvantages, the **secret** key must be shared between the intended parties and the whole encryption procedure will be as secure as the security used for that key exchange. That is why usually other mechanisms such as asymmetric encryption are used only for the key-exchange."

    "A futher categorization of symmetric encryption algorithms is between those with authentication features and those without. Both provide a way to securely transmit a meesage, however, [authenticated Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) also allows, among other things, to verify whether the ciphered message has been modified.\n",
