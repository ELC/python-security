    "Asymmetric encryption does not have passwords or keys like symmetric but rather it splits the security into a pair of keys, one used to encrypt (usually called Public Key) and another used to decrypt (usually call Private Key). As the name implies one can be shared publicly and the other should be kept secret. This method is also known as [**Public-key cryptography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).\n",

    "The keys are sequences of bytes generated together and are mathematically linked, they are also called \"Key Pair\".

    "The idea of a [Digital Signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) is basically reversing Public Key Encryption, that is, instead of encrypting messages that only the holder of the Private Key can decrypt, a message is encrypted with the Private Key so that everyone else can decrypt it using the Public Key. In this case, even though the message is encrypted, the word **signature** is used to represent that it is no secret. The signature itself has the same format as an encrypted message, it is a sequence of bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme does not provide **privacy**, since everyone can decrypt the signature, but it provides **Authentication** (Only the holder of the Private Key could have signed this message) and in some context also legal **Non-Repudiation**. Some countries consider that digitally signed files/messages are subject to non-repudiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Key Pair is exactly the the same as the one used in Public Key Encryption, however the terminology changes to avoid confusion. If Public Key Encryption is an asymmetric analog as symmetric encryption, digital signatures can be thought of as an asymmetric analog of HMACs."

    "One way to implement Public Key Encryption is through [**Certificates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate), a certificate is something bigger in scope than the Key Pair because the Key Pair is simply two sequences of bytes whereas the certificate includes not only the public key but also information about the algorithm, versioning, subject and issuer information and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a Key Pair is enough to encrypt and decrypt but a certificate has metadata and additional information to establish a **secure channel of communication**. One of the most widely used algorithms for Public Key Encryption is [`RSA`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) and the current standard for certificate is [`X.509`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) (which uses RSA Public Key Encryption). Certificate based communication is used in most website, the key indicator is the use of TLS, more commonly reflected by the use of HTTPS (instead of HTTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the information a certificate contains is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information about the **identity** (Email, Organization Name, Country, State, [among others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request#Procedure)) of who generated the Public Key (the subject).\n",
    "- A **digital signature** [^1] that validates the identity information is correct and it corresponds to the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of this approach is that nothing impedes an attacker to sign their own certificates, i.e. anyone can claim being anyone else. These are the so-called [self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate). To avoid that, the signature should come from a trusted third party, known as [**Certificate Authority**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). It needs to be an independent and trusted-by-everyone party that validates the identity of who is generating the Public Key. This is necessary if the subject is unknown or could not be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the subject acts as its own CA, generating a self-signed certificate, it triggers warnings in most environments, e.g. most programming libraries will throw validation errors. Web browsers will consider a self-signed certificate to be **insecure**. It is not a matter of security (i.e. the data will be encrypted anyway) but rather a matter of trust, trusting that the received Public Key comes from the intended subject and that there is no other man-in-the-middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For debugging and testing, self-signed certificates are usually not a concern, for all other use cases, a certificate signed by a CA should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a certificate signed by a CA, one has to submit a [**Certificate Signing Request**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request), it normally takes several days and it is usually paid service, they also validate that the identity information corresponds to the one asking for the validation. A CA will not sign certificates to anyone on behalf of anyone else, i.e. I cannot get a CA signing a certificate saying I am Google.\n",

    "As opposed to symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption does not rely on a single key shared across parties. Instead, a Key Pair, consisting of a Public and a Private Key which are mathematically linked, is generated by each party, then the public keys are shared. The public key is used to encrypt the message and only the linked Private Key can decrypt it.\n",
