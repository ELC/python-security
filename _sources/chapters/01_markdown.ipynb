    "# Markdown based Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Book allows Markdown Based Notebooks, these are plain text instead of the json based format of the traditional notebooks (.ipynb). There are some things to keep in mind when using this format as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a [traditional Jupyter version](02_jupyter.ipynb) of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Disadvantages of Markdown Based Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebook is plain text, i.e. easier to manipulate, friendlier with git and does not require any special software.\n",
    "- Load time is faster and can be modified in any text editor.\n",
    "- Does not require any software to be installed, not even Python, the book can be built in a CI/CD pipeline.\n",
    "- More resilient to format errors, i.e. if the ipynb is an invalid JSON the whole notebook cannot be rendered.\n",
    "- It is easier to add tags to code cells, no need for plugins or addons.\n",
    "- Readers will have the additional option to download the chapter as a markdown file\n",
    "- Readers can execute code directly on the site with Thebe (this is also possible with ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Markdown notebooks the output for any code cell is not shown before building the notebook.\n",
    "- The notebook needs to be executed at build time.\n",
    "- Kernel details should be provide at the top as metadata.\n",
    "- No actual separation \"in cells\", everything is a long text file.\n",
    "- For local builds using Windows, Python 3.7 should be used - 3.8+ is not yet supported.\n",
    "- No support for Colab (GPU) or Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "If the notebook requires external tools for the kernel (e.g. Matlab), the only available format is the Traditional Jupyter (.ipynb)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "If you want support for Binder and / or Colab Execution (e.g. for GPU processing), only Traditional Jupyter (.ipynb) are supported\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are supported by all renderers as they are part of the basic set of features of Markdown. Some examples were extracted from the [official docs](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)."
