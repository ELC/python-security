    "There are two main types of encryption, symmetric and asymmetric, this chapter will cover symmetric encryption.\n",

    "Symmetric encryption provides a way to hide the original information in a reversible way. When using authenticated algorithms, if the encrypted message is modified, when decrypted, the output will be have no sense. Authenticated algorithms can detect changes and throw errors. There are many implementations of symmetric algorithms, many are low-level like AES but are more cross-platform whereas other such as Fernet have a more user-friendly approach but are only avaiable in certain programming languages."
